Good primer on what to expect and how to manage infant sleep.

Takeaways:

General
- consistency is everything.
- baby needs to learn to fall asleep independently at bedtime.
- babies tend to wake up around 6-7am, and need 11 hrs of sleep. So bedtime should be around 7-8pm.
- object permanence: Baby learns object permanence around 4-6mo. This causes problems with sleep if they wake up from sleeping and anything is different from when they fell asleep (location, sound, presence of parent, presence of pacifier, etc.)

Sleep "Power Tools"
1. White noise (0+ mo)
2. Swaddling (0-4 mo): Have to stop when baby can roll over
3. Pacifier (0-6 mo): Will eventually cause problems when baby learns object permanence if it pops out while they are sleeping.
4. Managing Sleep schedule (0+ mo): Key is being very very consistent. Consistent bedtime routine, including order and timing.

"SWAP" (Sleep With Assistance Plan):
Plan: Help baby get close to sleep, but let them fall asleep independently

1. Fuss It Out: Put in crib calm & drowsy. Set timer for 15-20 min. (Different from "Cry it out" because we're just trying it out - not committed.)
2. The Double Take: Soothe until fully asleep, put in bed, wake slightly.
3. Gradual Weaning: do progressively less of whatever it takes to get baby to sleep
3a. Gradual Weaning - Motion Junkies: Switch to jiggling crib, and jiggle less each night
3b. Gradual Weaning - Suckers: (1) Let them suck until drowsy, then pop them off. Repeat as necessary. (2) "Anything but" - get them to sleep by any other method. Then later wean them off that new method.
3c. Gradual Weaning - Cuddlers: Move further and further away each night.

"SLIP" (Sleep Learning Independence Plan), aka Cry It Out
Plan: Let them cry themselves to sleep

Either "Gradual extinction" (i.e. keep coming back in to check at progressively longer intervals) or "Full extinction". Both work. Both are safe for baby. Parents might feel better about gradual extinction, but full extinction might work slightly faster. If you start with Full Extinction, you have to stay the course.

How:
1. Make naps happen by any means necessary. (But avoid catnaps)
2. Do your relaxing, consistent bedtime routine but leave out the final “soothe to sleep” step.
3. Continue to swaddle (if safe)
4. Stop using pacifier
5. Safe sleep location
6. Put baby to sleep at appropriate bedtime (7-8pm)
7. Use consistent bedtime words
8. Put baby in bed & leave room
9. Allow your child the space to figure out how to fall asleep without you. She may get angry, sad, furious, or some combination thereof. Is she safe? Fed? Loved? If the answers are “yes,” you’ve done your job. She’s working on something new, and from her perspective, it’s a frustrating challenge. It’s okay for her to be frustrated.
10. Don't give up!

Naps
Conventions:
1. Use age-appropriate soothing
2. Consistent: same location, same(ish) time, same pre-nap routine
3. Timing is everything (awake long enough to have sleep-debt, but not so long as to be overtired):

Wake-time method (how long to be awake before napping):
- 0-1.5mo: 0.5-1 hrs
- 1.5-3 mo: 1-1.5 hrs
- 4 mo: 1-2 hrs
- 6 mo: 1.5-3 hrs
- 9-12 mo: 2-4 hrs
- 12-18 mo: 5-6 hrs (if 1 nap), 3-4 hrs (if 2 naps)

Nap homework:
0-3 months: naps are a crapshoot. Use Power Tools and don't let baby stay awake too long
3-6 months: naps should be more predictable. Ideal age to make good nap habits: age-appropriate soothing, same dark place every day, 10-15min pre-nap routine.
6-9 months: naps should be ~1.5hrs. Should have a pre-nap routine and naps should be at same time and place every day
9-12 months: should have two 1+ hr naps.
